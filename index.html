        <p>
          I'm a future-focused full stack developer with a proven track record of leadership, adaptability,
           and team development. After eight years in the fitness industry — rising from personal trainer to
            general manager — and earlier leadership roles in fast-paced, hands-on environments, I've cultivated
             a strong foundation in problem-solving, team management, and performance optimization. Now, I'm 
             channeling that experience into building scalable, user-focused tech solutions. I bring the same 
             drive, discipline, and growth mindset to software development that powered my career progression, 
             and I’m excited to contribute to innovative, impactful tech teams. My background in managing people, 
             driving performance, and adapting quickly to challenges gives me a unique edge in tech environments 
             that value collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement.
