            Below is a curated collection of the web applications I’ve developed — 
            each one built to solve real problems, explore innovative ideas, or push my 
            skills further as a full stack software engineer. From productivity tools to
            interactive games, these projects demonstrate my commitment to clean design,
            functional code, and user-focused experiences.

            <h3>Minesweeper</h3>
            <p>
              Minesweeper was the first project I developed, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              It served as an early challenge to push my skills, deepen my understanding of core web technologies,
              and apply problem-solving in a hands-on way.

            <h3>ElevateSelf</h3>
            <p>ElevateSelf is a productivity web app that helps users set goals, break them into tasks,
               and schedule them on a visual calendar. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS,
                it was my first full-stack project using the MEN stack.

            <h3>myPR.IO</h3>
              <p>This app was inspired by my 8 years of experience working in the fitness industry as 
                a personal trainer. Over the years, I discovered that the average gym-goer struggles 
                with consistency not because of lack of effort, but due to a lack of support
